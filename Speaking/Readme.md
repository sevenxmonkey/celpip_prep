### Talk about a time when you interacted with an animal. Maybe you can talk about a family pet, a farm or zoo animal, or an animal in the wild. What kind of animal was it, what happened, and why do you remember the experience?

- How I met the cat. I won't forget her because she accompany me through the most difficult days.
- I was experiencing a tough time, always working late and sometime worked until midnight.
