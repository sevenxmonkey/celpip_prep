# Task 1
## Set 1 Test 1

Read the following information.

Last weekend you attended the Canada Day community picnic. The event was a potluck, so everyone brought a dish of food to share. Some people, including you, have allergies or can’t eat some types of food, such as nuts and seafood, so you included a list of ingredients with your dish. No one else did this.

Write an email to the community picnic organizer in about 150-200 words. Your email should do the following things:

- Express your overall enjoyment of last week’s event.
- Explain why each potluck dish needs a list of ingredients.
- Describe how the potluck could be differently organized next year.

`Sample`

Dear Canada Day community picnic organizer

Thank you for the wonderful event last weekend. I had an enjoyable time interacting with the community on such an important celebration in Canada.

I noticed on the day that participants did not include a list of ingredients for the dishes they brought to the potluck. There are individuals including myself who have some food allergies such as those related to nuts and seafood. The allergies can in some cases be fatal which is why a list of ingredients would be helpful to better assist individuals to make the right food choices based on their allergies.

May I suggest that for the event next year, that participants are requested to supply a list of ingredients to go with the dishes they bring to the potluck to avoid any issues that may occur from an individual eating a tainted item that may aggravate their food allergy.

I believe that having the list of ingredients will be widely received and will mean that people can be more involved in the event and try the various dishes without risking their health.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to another wonderful event next year.

## Set 2 Test 1

Read the following information.

You live in a house near a park. Recently, a lot of teenagers have been meeting in the park at night. They are very noisy.

Write an email to the local government in about 150-200 words. Your email should do the following things:

- Provide information about where you live.
- Explain the problem and how it affects your life.
- Suggest a way to solve the problem.

`Sample`

To whom it may concern,

I would like to register a complaint. I currently live in Whistler, a small 3 bedroom house overlooking the village green. We moved here in the fall of 2013 however since then some of the local kids have started meeting up in the park at night and causing a lot of noise.

While I feel this would be fine in the early evening, it becomes a problem when it carries on until midnight. Sometimes even later than that!

My job requires me to work early mornings, I need to be alert and friendly throughout the day. Being woken up several times throughout the night is definitely having a negative impact on my work performance.

While I have tried to ask them to keep the noise down on numerous occasions it has been to no avail. I feel I have no recourse but to contact you now in the hopes that you could enforce some form of curfew on the park. I would suggest no loud noises after maybe 9pm or 10pm. The local residents and myself would much appreciate your consideration on this matter.

Regards

Gwen T. Alderidge
