# Set 1 Test 1
## Task 1

### Read the following information.

Last weekend you attended the Canada Day community picnic. The event was a potluck, so everyone brought a dish of food to share. Some people, including you, have allergies or can’t eat some types of food, such as nuts and seafood, so you included a list of ingredients with your dish. No one else did this.

### Write an email to the community picnic organizer in about 150-200 words. Your email should do the following things:

- Express your overall enjoyment of last week’s event.
- Explain why each potluck dish needs a list of ingredients.
- Describe how the potluck could be differently organized next year.

### `My polished answer`

Dear Canada Day community picnic organizer,

Hope everything goes well with you. Thank you very much for organizing our event. My friends and I had a lot of fun and were very impressed by the wonderful potluck. I am so exicited that we are living in such a dynamic community where residents come from diverse cultural backgrounds. Also, it is really an awesome experience exploring different food cultures by tasting a variety of dishes.

I noticed on the day participants did not include a list of ingredients for the dishes they brought to the potluck. However, there are individuals including myself who have some food allegies such as those related to nuts and seafood. The allergies can in some cases be fatal which is why a list of ingredients would be heapful to better assist individuals to make the right food choices based on their allergies.

May I suggest that for the event next year, that participants are requested to supply a list of ingredients to go with the dishes they bring to the potluck to avoid any issues that may occur from an individual eating a tainted item that may aggravate their food allergy.

I believe that having the list of ingredients will be widely received and will mean that people can be more involved in the event and try the various dishes without risking their health.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to another wonderful event next year.

## Task 2

### Read the following information.

Online vs. Print News Survey

Your local newspaper is experiencing low sales of its newspapers since many readers are now choosing the online version. Its current number of online subscribers is now three times the number of print subscribers. The newspaper has sent a survey to all of its print and online subscribers to see whether there is enough demand to keep the print version.

### Choose the option that you prefer. Explain the reasons for your choice. Why do you prefer your choice? Write about 150-200 words.

- Option A: Stop producing the print version of the newspaper.

- Option B: Keep producing both the print and online versions.

### `My polished answer`

I suggest keeping producing both the print and online versions for the benefit of our media diversity, the unique cultural value of newspapers, as well as the wellness of senior citizens.

Firstly, as a unique format of media, print newspaper plays a significant role in our culture and society. It is not only just an information media but also a cultural symbol for time and history. Canceling the print version newspaper will no doubt damage the diversity of social media thus damage that of our society.

There are individuals including myself who purchase the print version for collecting purposes. Also, many artists create their work using newspaper. Stopping producing them will discourage those specific groups of subscribers, thus the total number of subscribers might decrease.

Additionally, there are a lot of senior citizens who have difficulties using online reading applications. Some subscribers have the habit of reading print newspapers for most of their life. It is hard to imagine what their life is going to be one day the print newspaper disappears. 

Therefore, although the number of online subscribers is now greater than that of the print versions, I still think it will be more beneficial to keep both of them.

## Task 1

### Read the following information.
You have registered for a six-month computer training program at Sambro Community College. You want to rent a room from Sambro Housing Agency.
### Write an email to the agency in about 150-200 words. Your email should do the following things:

### `My polished answer`
Dear Sambro Housing Agency,

My name is Seven. I just registered for the computer training program at Sambro Community College and would like to rent a room from your agency. My program will be 6 months from August to December. I hope my rent will start on August 20, which is 7 days before the training start date so I can enough time to settle down everything and be well prepared.

It would be best there is a studio for me with one bedroom and one bathroom. If a that is not available, it is also fine to live with one or two roommates. But I still want to have my own bedroom and bathroom. I would appreciate it if my roommate is also a female and ideally she is a student from the same program with me so we can help with each other about the training stuff.

I really appreciate it if I can get more information such as room availabilities, cost, and application process from you. Please let me know if I need to provide you with any extra information or material. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best,

Seven Xu
