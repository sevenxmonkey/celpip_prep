# Set 1 Test 1
## Task 1

### Read the following information.

Last weekend you attended the Canada Day community picnic. The event was a potluck, so everyone brought a dish of food to share. Some people, including you, have allergies or can’t eat some types of food, such as nuts and seafood, so you included a list of ingredients with your dish. No one else did this.

### Write an email to the community picnic organizer in about 150-200 words. Your email should do the following things:

- Express your overall enjoyment of last week’s event.
- Explain why each potluck dish needs a list of ingredients.
- Describe how the potluck could be differently organized next year.

### `My polished answer`

Dear Canada Day community picnic organizer,

Hope everything goes well with you. Thank you very much for organizing our event. My friends and I had a lot of fun and were very impressed by the wonderful potluck. I am so exicited that we are living in such a dynamic community where residents come from diverse cultural backgrounds. Also, it is really an awesome experience exploring different food cultures by tasting a variety of dishes.

I noticed on the day participants did not include a list of ingredients for the dishes they brought to the potluck. However, there are individuals including myself who have some food allegies such as those related to nuts and seafood. The allergies can in some cases be fatal which is why a list of ingredients would be heapful to better assist individuals to make the right food choices based on their allergies.

May I suggest that for the event next year, that participants are requested to supply a list of ingredients to go with the dishes they bring to the potluck to avoid any issues that may occur from an individual eating a tainted item that may aggravate their food allergy.

I believe that having the list of ingredients will be widely received and will mean that people can be more involved in the event and try the various dishes without risking their health.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to another wonderful event next year.

## Task 2

### Read the following information.

Online vs. Print News Survey

Your local newspaper is experiencing low sales of its newspapers since many readers are now choosing the online version. Its current number of online subscribers is now three times the number of print subscribers. The newspaper has sent a survey to all of its print and online subscribers to see whether there is enough demand to keep the print version.

### Choose the option that you prefer. Explain the reasons for your choice. Why do you prefer your choice? Write about 150-200 words.

- Option A: Stop producing the print version of the newspaper.

- Option B: Keep producing both the print and online versions.

### `Polished answer`

I suggest keeping producing both the print and online versions for the benefit of our media diversity, the unique cultural value of newspapers, as well as the wellness of senior citizens.

Firstly, as a unique format of media, print newspaper plays a significant role in our culture and society. It is not only just an information media but also a cultural symbol for time and history. Canceling the print version newspaper will no doubt damage the diversity of social media thus damage that of our society.

There are individuals including myself who purchase the print version for collecting purposes. Also, many artists create their work using newspaper. Stopping producing them will discourage those specific groups of subscribers, thus the total number of subscribers might decrease.

Additionally, there are a lot of senior citizens who have difficulties using online reading applications. Some subscribers have the habit of reading print newspapers for most of their life. It is hard to imagine what their life is going to be one day the print newspaper disappears. 

Therefore, although the number of online subscribers is now greater than that of the print versions, I still think it will be more beneficial to keep both of them.

## Task 1

### Read the following information.
You have registered for a six-month computer training program at Sambro Community College. You want to rent a room from Sambro Housing Agency.
### Write an email to the agency in about 150-200 words. Your email should do the following things:
- Explain when you need to rent the room.
- Describe your requirements for the room.
- Ask about costs and the application process.

### `Polished answer`
Dear Sambro Housing Agency,

My name is Seven. I just registered for the computer training program at Sambro Community College and would like to rent a room from your agency. I need to rent a room for six months starting on August 20, which is 7 days before the training start date so I can enough time to settle down everything and be well prepared.

Ideally, I prefer to rent a studio or a 1-bedroom-1-bathroom apartment. If that is unavailable, I am fine with living with 1~2 roommates at most, and still, have my bathroom. As for roommate requirements, female roommates from the same program as me would be my preferences since we might have more common things to share both for school and life.

I would appreciate it if I can get more information such as room availabilities, cost, and application process provided. Please let me know if I need to send over any extra information or material. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best,

Seven Xu

## Task 2

### Read the following information.
Work-from-Home Survey

Your company wants to allow some employees to work from home. Not everyone can have this choice because some jobs must be done at the office. The company wants to know if this is fair by surveying your opinion about working from home.

### Choose the option that you prefer. Why do you prefer your choice? Explain the reasons for your choice. Write about 150-200 words.
- Option A: A work-from-home choice is fair.
- Option B: A work-from-home choice is not fair.

### `Polished answer`
Having partially employees work from home is harmful for our company culture as well as the long term development of all employees. It is not a fair policy for any company.

Firstly, Employees are very easy to skip their job duty without on-site supervision. It is difficult for managers to evaluate subordinates' work performances. From my personal experience, there are individuals who sometimes set their status to be "online" at the office APP but actually do their personal stuff, but finally get the same salary with those who work very hard. Therefore, both the employees' career growth and the efficiency of our company will be greatly decreased.

In addition, it is unequal for employees whose work must be done at the office. It is universally acknowledged that working from home is much more comfortable than sitting in the office for the whole day. Therefore, the policy would become a privilege for those who can work remotely. It will develop a huge gap between different groups of employees which is extremely negative to our company culture.

To sum up, in order to have a better teamwork environment and working efficiency we would better not have the work-from-home choice policy.

# Set 2 Test 1
## Task 1
### Read the following information.
You live in a house near a park. Recently, a lot of teenagers have been meeting in the park at night. They are very noisy.
### Write an email to the local government in about 150-200 words. Your email should do the following things:
- Provide information about where you live.
- Explain the problem and how it affects your life.
- Suggest a way to solve the problem.

### `My polished answer`
To whom it may concern,

I would like to register a complaint. I currently live in the Moreland Way Community. My house is located near a public park called River Oak Park. 

Recently, a number of teenagers have been gathering in the park every night and cauding a lot of noise. Their yelling sometimes continued until midnight which made it difficult for me to fall asleep. Due to that I always feel extremely tired in the daytime. I am not the only one having that concern.  There are many senior citizens and children living in that community. The noise at night has many negative effects on their sleep and daily routine. I have already heard a lot of complaints from our neighbors. 

For the whole wellness of our community, I would recommend setting an open time limitation from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm for the River Oak Park. In that way, residences could have a good sleep at night while teenagers can have good time daytime, which would be beneficial both for teenagers and residences. I think the policy will be supported by most residents in the community.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best,

Seven

### `Sample answer`


## Task 2
### Read the following information.
Field Trip Transportation

Your children’s grade 5 class teacher likes to take the children on field trips to museums or parks. Sometimes the teacher takes the children on public buses. Some parents are unhappy. They say the school should always use school buses even though it is more expensive. You have been asked to respond to an opinion survey.

### Choose the option that you prefer. Why do you prefer your choice? Explain the reasons for your choice. Write about 150-200 words.
- Option A: Public Transit: I think it’s okay for children to travel on public transit.
- Option B: School Buses: I would prefer children only travel on school buses.

### `李思嘉姐姐求您帮我改这一篇，小心心`

I think it is acceptable that 5th graders travel on public transit occasionally with their teachers' help because it not only is safe enough for students at that age but also has a positive impact on children's long-term development.

Firstly, it is a good opportunity for our kids to learn how to take public transit, which would be good preparation for their growing up and survival on their own. By showing kids how to buy tickets, where to find the transportation guide, and how to read the transit map of this city, students would learn a lot of knowledge and expand views on real society by their own eyes, which is rarely gained just from the textbooks. 

In addition, children in 5th grade are not too young to take the bus. Having been in school for 5 years, teenagers are familiar with keeping the order and follow the guide from their teachers. They have had the basic ability to protect themself from the dangers that younger kids might face. 

As the saying goes, "the tree growing in the greenhouse will never become a giant one". Instead of over-protecting students, why not have more confidence in those young people and let them explore the outside world.
